# MEC-Agent-System

**Agent-Based System for Multi-Access Edge Computing**

## Overview

This project implements an agent-based system designed to optimize resource allocation in Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) environments. The system enables offloading of computational tasks from mobile devices to edge servers, taking into consideration factors such as battery level, bandwidth, and task size. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of resource usage in distributed edge computing scenarios.

## Features

- **Task Offloading:** Dynamically offloads tasks from mobile devices to edge servers based on predefined criteria.
- **Resource Optimization:** Considers various parameters such as battery level, bandwidth, and task size to optimize resource allocation.
- **Agent-Based Architecture:** Utilizes agents to manage and coordinate task offloading, ensuring efficient use of MEC resources.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle multiple agents and devices, making it suitable for large-scale MEC deployments.
- **Simulation Environment:** Includes a simulation setup to test and validate the agent-based system under different conditions.

## Usage

### Running the Simulation:

- Use the command line interface to start the simulation and monitor the results.
- The simulation output will display the performance metrics, including resource utilization, task completion times, and agent decisions.
